            <h1>Old job</h1>
            <p>I decided to take this course after feeling burned out managing a cafe. All that free coffee was really
                nice!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I used to work on an automatic Slayer espresso machine (reference photo provided)</li>
                    <li>Learned how to be a barista at Octane in Homewood.</li>
                    <li>Became manager after a transition into Revelator.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Leisure</h2>
            <p>In my free time I love to write. I channel a lot of my creative energy into short stories and modulars
                for
                Dungeons & Dragons.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I Started playing D&D about 5 years ago.</li>
                    <li>It combines my love for writiing with a creative outlet that prevents me from becoming a recluse! Yay for social activities!</li>
                    <li>I have a campaign that I've been running with the same group for over a year as the dungeon master.</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Cat food</h3>
        <p> My wife and I have two cats, Rook and Vespa</p>
        <!--You ever wondered what cat food tastes like?-->
        <h4>Prior schooling</h4>
        <p>I attended UAB until last fall. I was in the English program. My focus was in literature. I studied the
            literature of the US for the majority of my time there.</p>
        <!--God, that song was so bad, but so good! I'm blue da ba dee da ba daaaaaaaaaaaa!-->
        <h5>How different</h5>
        <p>It's hard for me not to punctuate like I normally would. Everything else feels good!</p>
        <!--Sometimes we won't admit we like something, but we do... Like cat food! Kidding.-->
