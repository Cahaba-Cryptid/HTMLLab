                <h2>My Most Recent Job</h2>
                <p>I decided to take this course after feeling burned out managing a cafe. All that free coffee was
                    really
                    nice!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I used to work on an automatic Slayer espresso machine (reference photo below).</li>
                    <li>Learned how to be a barista at Octane in Homewood.</li>
                    <li>Became manager after a transition into Revelator.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Leisure</h3>
                <p>In my free time I love to write. I channel a lot of my creative energy into short stories and
                    modulars
                    for
                    Dungeons & Dragons.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I Started playing D&D about 5 years ago.</li>
                    <li>It combines my love for writiing with a creative outlet that prevents me from becoming a
                        recluse!
                        Yay for social activities!</li>
                    <li>I have a campaign that I've been running with the same group for over a year as the dungeon
                        master.

                <h5>Prior schooling</h5>
                <p>I attended UAB until last fall. I was in the English program. My focus was in literature. I studied
                    the
                    literature of the US for the majority of my time there.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I attended Troy University before UAB.</li>
                    <li>My favotire professor taught many of my American literature classes.</li>
                    <li>His name is Vic Camp.

            <p>It's hard for me not to punctuate like I normally would. Everything else feels good!</p>
