                <p>I decided to take this course after feeling pretty burned out managing a cafe. All that free coffee was really nice.</p>

                <p>In my free time I love to write. I channel a lot of my creative energy into short stories and modulars for Dungeons & Dragons.</p>
            <!--I need to buy cat food.-->
            <h3>Cat food</h3>
                <p> My wife and I have two cats, Rook and Vespa</p>
            <!--You ever wondered what cat food tastes like?-->
            <h4>Prior schooling</h4>
                <p>I attended UAB until last fall. I was in the English program. My focus was in literature. I studied the literature of the US for the majority of my time there.</p>
